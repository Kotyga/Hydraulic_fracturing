# Data description:

* Well_id is the unique identifier of the well.
* Reservoir pressure — fluid pressure in the reservoir, [pressure].
* ISIP (Instantaneous Shut-In Pressure— - fluid pressure after mini-hydraulic fracturing 5, [pressure].
* Closure Pressure — liquid pressure when the crack is completely
closed, [pressure].
* PAD Volume — the volume of pure liquid injected into the crack, [volume].
* Fluid Efficiency — the efficiency of hydraulic fracturing fluid (calculated as the ratio of the crack volume to the volume of the injected fluid), [0-1].
* Transmissibility (throughput) — coefficient, characterizing the resistance of the liquid to flow through the formation.
* Total Prop Mass — the total mass of the injected proppant during main processing, [mass].
* Max Prop Conc — the maximum concentration of the proppant during the main treatment, [concentration].
